Special relativity is a theory proposed by Albert Einstein that describes the propagation of matter and light at high speeds. It was invented to explain the observed behavior of electric and magnetic fields, which it beautifully reconciles into a single so-called electromagnetic field, and also to resolve a number of paradoxes that arise when considering travel at large speeds. Special relativity also explains the behavior of fast-traveling particle, including the fact that fast-traveling unstable particles appear decay more slowly than identical particles traveling more slowly. Special relativity is an indispensable tool of modern physics, and its predictions have been experimentally tested time and time again without any discrepancies turning up. Special relativity reduces to Newtonian mechanics in the limit of small speeds.
